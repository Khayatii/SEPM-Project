# Vcon: Secure Meeting Platform
Our project aims at developing a Secure Meeting Platform that will track each meeting attendee's IP address and have the ability to block suspicious users before they join the meeting if a VPN or proxy is detected. There will be an automatic Proxy and VPN detector so that the intruder is not able to forward his/her traffic through the VPN server and join the meet after it. Our system will block this type of traffic and will make the meet secure. We need to record each user's IP address for tracking purposes, which may limit the platform's audience and automatically block the person who tries to do malpractices and send the alert to the host of the meeting. We also have the AI Chatbot which blocks unwanted messages or spamming in the chat box. In our project we discussed the prioritization of Stakeholders, Work Breakdown Structure, SWOT Analysis, Risk Management, System Architecture, Gantt chart and many Diagrams like- Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, ER Diagrams, Sequence Diagram, Collaboration Diagram and we also made the framework for our website for better understanding of our project.
